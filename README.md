# Springboot-restapi-openfeign

* OpenFeign is used to call third party services.
* Spring cloud OpenFeign is the declarative styling of calling microservices.
* We have to enable the main class with `@EnableFiegnClients` to work for openfiegn.  
* `@FeignClient` is the annotation for interfaces declaring that a REST client with that interface should be created.
